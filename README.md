# LangChain and RAG Applications üöÄ
This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks from the Coursera course Generative AI Applications with RAG and LangChain.

## üìö Notebooks Overview

### 1. LangChain Retriever
A comprehensive guide to using various retrievers in LangChain to efficiently extract relevant document segments from text. Learn about:

- Vector Store-backed Retriever
- Multi-Query Retriever
- Self-Querying Retriever
- Parent Document Retriever

### 2. LangChain Vector Store
Learn how to create and configure vector databases (Chroma DB and FAISS) to store document embeddings for efficient similarity searches.

### 3. Embedding Documents with watsonx
Explore how to use embedding models from watsonx.ai and Hugging Face to transform documents into vector representations.

### 4. LangChain Text Splitter
Master different text splitting techniques to enhance model responsiveness:

- Character splitting
- Recursive character splitting
- Code splitting
- Markdown header splitting
- HTML splitting

# 5. QA Bot with LangChain
Build a complete question-answering bot using:

- IBM watsonx.ai for LLM capabilities
- PyPDF for document loading
- ChromaDB for vector storage
- Gradio for creating a user-friendly interface

## üîç Key Concepts
These notebooks demonstrate the complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline:

- Document Loading: Processing various file formats
- Text Splitting: Breaking documents into manageable chunks
- Embedding: Converting text to vector representations
- Storage: Using vector databases for efficient retrieval
- Retrieval: Finding the most relevant information
- Generation: Producing accurate and contextual responses

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- LangChain: Framework for building LLM applications
- watsonx.ai: IBM's platform for AI and foundation models
- ChromaDB: Open-source vector database
- FAISS: Facebook AI Similarity Search
- Gradio: Tool for building interactive web interfaces
